 <h3>Landman</h3>
 <p>I am invested in all the members of the Norris family. Each of them is different, but I can empathize with each one of them. I think it's because regardless of how flawed they are, they are all good-hearted.</p>
 <h3>Your Friends and Neighbors</h3>
 <p>Jon Hamm doesn't seem like a nice person, so it is nice to watch him struggle. Yet, the more I watch it, the more appealing he becomes. Perhaps because he is self-deprecating. </p>
 <h3>The Last of Us</h3>
 <p>I thought this season would be boring, especially since Joel gets killed early in the season. I was pleasantly surprised that Ellie and Dina's relationship filled that hole. In the first episode Ellie seems like a simple character full of bravado. In subsequent episode, I realized she is far more complex and interesting.</p>
