<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I recently graduated from Computer Science at the University of Florida. In Fall 2025, I will begin my graduate
  degree in Computer Science specializing in computer graphics at the University of Utah.
  I enjoy cycling, crossfit and spending time with my pets, Piper and Baxter.
</p>

<p>In preperation for my graduate program, I am spending the summer reviewing Calculus, Probability and Linear Algebra. 
  I am also studying HTML/CSS/JS and learning as much as I can abouot Ray Tracing. I hope these summer studies will make
  me a prospective candidate for Cem Yuksel's Research team at the Computer Graphics Lab. I want to be his assistant 
  so that I can gain experience as a researcher and increase my prospects of getting accepted into a Ph.D. program
</p>
<p>My plan is to complete my Masters degree and pursue a Ph.D. degree. Afterwards, I would like to work as a researcher 
  at Nvidia.
